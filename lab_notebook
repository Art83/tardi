# Assembly and annotation of eucariotic genome
# project folder is ~/tardi, original_files, intermediate and results folders are
# ~/tardi/original_files, ~/tardi/intermediate, ~/tardi/results respectively


# No need to assemble the genome since it takes a lot of time and computational resources
# Download the assembled genome via the link provided. It goes to original_files


# Extracting the protein sequences using Perl script provided
perl getAnnoFasta.pl augustus.whole.gff

# Checking the number of proteins

grep '>' augustus.whole.aa | wc -l

#..which gives us 16435! that's a lot

# Narrowing down the list of potential candidated through the results of TSM of
