# Assembly and annotation of eucariotic genome
# project folder is ~/tardi, original_files, intermediate and results folders are
# ~/tardi/original_files, ~/tardi/intermediate, ~/tardi/results respectively


# No need to assemble the genome since it takes a lot of time and computational resources
# Download the assembled genome via the link provided. It goes to original_files


# Extracting the protein sequences using Perl script provided
perl getAnnoFasta.pl augustus.whole.gff

# Checking the number of proteins

grep '>' augustus.whole.aa | wc -l

#..which gives us 16435! that's a lot

# Narrowing down the list of potential candidated through the results of TSM of
# chromatin fraction

# Making a local database of all proteins received with blast+
makeblastdb -in tardi/intermediate/augustus.whole.aa -dbtype prot -out tardi/intermediate/prot_seq

# Using blastp algorithm against the local base from previous step
blastp -db tardi/intermediate/prot_seq -query tardi/intermediate/peptides.fa -out tardi/results/result_db1.txt -outfmt 6

# tried to cutoff with -evalue 1e-5,4,3,2, also tried -max_target_seqs, -num_alignments

# As a result 92 sequences
# Going to annotaion servers and blast
